# Node.JS app

Well, because I lost about 98% of the things I learned during the Server Side Scripting course I needed to refresh my mind on Node & Express.

To do that I watched a tutorial on YouTube called "Express Tutorial". I typed along and all the things in this branch are the end result from that.

The plan is to branch off and customize the code in order to get a functional Node.JS Funda App.
